# Using Keybase and GPG

I have had a [Keybase](https://keybase.io/hoshposh) account for a while. Recently I wanted to use the keys associated with the account to sign Git commits.

Not sure I have got this working as I would have hoped, since I have both a corporate and personal account with different keys.

But I did find some useful resources in case I want to continue this yak-shaving experiment.
